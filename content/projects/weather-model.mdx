# Weather Prediction Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to work with machine learning algorithms and data analysis. I developed a weather prediction model that analyzes historical weather data to forecast local weather patterns with 85% accuracy.

## Technical Implementation
- **Data Collection**: Gathered 5 years of historical weather data from local meteorological stations
- **Data Processing**: Used Pandas for data cleaning and feature engineering
- **Model Training**: Implemented multiple algorithms including Random Forest and Linear Regression
- **Visualization**: Created interactive charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Key Features
- Real-time weather predictions
- Historical data analysis
- Interactive data visualizations
- Model performance metrics dashboard

## Challenges Overcome
- Handling missing data points in historical records
- Optimizing model performance for local weather patterns
- Creating intuitive visualizations for complex meteorological data

## Results
The final model achieved 85% accuracy in predicting weather patterns up to 7 days in advance, significantly outperforming baseline models.
